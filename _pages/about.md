Hello! I'm Mohsin Ali, and I would like to provide an overview of my professional profile. I have recently completed my postdoctoral research and am currently working independently.

Long story short, I obtained my M.Phil in Molecular Plant Breeding from the Department of Plant Sciences at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan, collaborating with [Dr. Umar Masood Qureshi](https://www.qau.edu.pk/profile.php?id=804029) on a QTL identification project in wheat. This experience fueled my interest in quantitative genetics, prompting me to pursue a Ph.D. at Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Jiankang Wang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294609.htm).

During my Ph.D., I concentrated on genomic selection in wheat, evaluating prediction accuracy through empirical and simulated data. Subsequently, I undertook a Post-Doc with [Dr. Li Huihui's](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm) Quantitative Genetics Group at ICS-CAAS in Beijing, focusing on genetic diversity and marker-trait associations in Pakistani wheat diversity panel.

## Research Interests:

- Wheat genetics and breeding
- Applied Quantitative Genetics
- Phenotype and genotype association studies (QTL, GWAS, GS)
- Data wrangling and visualization

Iâ€™m very happy to talk about my research projects and sciences with you. Please feel free to contact me via [email](mali1990@yahoo.com).
