I am a quantitative geneticist. My work focuses on using genomics and computational methods to accelerate crop improvement. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China, working with [Dr. Li Huihui](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm). I completed my Ph.D. in Plant Breeding and Quantitative Genetics at ICS-CAAS under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Jiankang Wang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294609.htm). My PhD research focused on evaluating the prediction accuracy of various genomic selection models using empirical and simulated data sets.

My research passion lies in association genetics (QTL, GWAS, GS), quantitative genetics and genomics. Using data analysis to understand and ultimately uncover the properties of genetic variation responsible for phenotypic variability has always been one of my career goals.


Iâ€™m very happy to talk about my research projects and sciences with you. Please feel free to contact me via [email](mali1990@yahoo.com).
