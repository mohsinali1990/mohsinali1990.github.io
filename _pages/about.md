Hi! I am an early-career **Quantitative Geneticist** specializing in leveraging **genomics** for **crop improvement**. My research work involves key areas such as **Plant Breeding and Genomics**, focused on enhancing our understanding of genetic variation and its impact on phenotypic traits.

Previously, I worked as **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China. During this time, I had the privilege to work with [Dr. Li Huihui](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm). I received my **Ph.D** in **Plant Breeding and Quantitative Genetics** from ICS-CAAS under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Jiankang Wang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294609.htm). My PhD research focused on evaluating the prediction accuracy of various genomic selection models using empirical and simulated data sets. 

I am deeply grateful to [Dr. Awais Rasheed](https://www.qau.edu.pk/profile.php?id=804030) for their invaluable guidance and support throughout my research career. Their expertise in Wheat Genomics and continued mentorship have been instrumental in shaping my path as a Quantitative Geneticist.

### Research Interests
My research passion is rooted in:
- **Quantitative Genetics & Genomics**: understanding the complexities of genetic variation responsible for phenotypic variability
- **Association Genetics**: including **Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL)** mapping and **GWAS**
- **Genomic Selection (GS)**: estimation of molecular markerâ€“based breeding values of plants for the trait of interest
