Hi! I am an early career **Quantitative Geneticist** specializing in leveraging **genomics** and **computational methods** to advance **crop improvement**. My work covers key areas such as **Plant breeding**, **Association Genetics**, and **Genomic Selection (GS)**, all focused on enhancing our understanding of genetic variation and its impact on phenotypic traits.

Previously, I worked as **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China. During this time, I had the privilege to work with [Dr. Li Huihui](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm). I received my **Ph.D** in Plant Breeding and Quantitative Genetics from ICS-CAAS under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Jiankang Wang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294609.htm). My PhD research focused on evaluating the prediction accuracy of various genomic selection models using empirical and simulated data sets.

### Research Interests
My research passion is rooted in:
- **Quantitative Genetics & Genomics**: understanding the complexities of genetic variation responsible for phenotypic variability
- **Association Genetics**: including **Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL)** mapping and **GWAS**
- **Genomic Selection (GS)**: estimation of molecular markerâ€“based breeding values of plants for the trait of interest

### Let's Connect
I am always open to discussing about my research projects and sciences in the field of ***Plant Genetics and Genomics***. Please feel free to reach out via [email](mali1990@yahoo.com).
