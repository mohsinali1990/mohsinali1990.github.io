Hello! My name is Mohsin Ali. I present an overview of my professional profile. I have recently completed my Postdoctorate and am now working independently.

Long story short, I did M.Phil with [Dr. Umar Masood Qureshi](https://www.qau.edu.pk/profile.php?id=804029) in Molecular Plant Breeding from Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan. My research project was to identify QTL associated with yield and related traits in wheat, which involved a lot of field phenotyping, statistical genetics and bioinformatics. This QTL mapping project developed my interest in quantitative genetics. After completing M.Phil degree, I was awarded a scholarship to pursue Ph.D. degree abroad at ICS-CAAS in Quantitive Genetics. I had the very good fortune to be advised by [Prof. Dr. Jiankang Wang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294609.htm) during my Ph.D. I was also co-advised by [Dr. Li Huihui](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm), [Dr. Luyan Zhang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294611.htm) and [Dr. Awais Rasheed](http://www.qau.edu.pk/profile.php?id=804030) on my Ph.D. research projects. My Ph.D. thesis focused on evaluating the genomic prediction accuracy of qualitative and quantitative traits in wheat using empirical and simulation-based studies. Right after completing Ph.D., I started Post-Doc with [Dr. Li Huihui](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm) in the [Quantiative Genetics Group](https://isbreeding.caas.cn/) at the Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China. During this time, my research was centered on the analysis of genetic diversity and the identification of marker-trait associations in Pakistani wheat diverstiy panel.

## Research Interests:

- Wheat genetics and breeding
- Applied Quantitative Genetics
- Phenotype and genotype association studies (QTL, GWAS, GS)
- Data wrangling and visualization

Iâ€™m very happy to talk about my research projects and sciences with you. Please feel free to contact me via [email](mali1990@yahoo.com).
