Hello! My name is Mohsin Ali. I am currently working as a Post-Doc researcher in the [Quantiative Genetics Group](https://isbreeding.caas.cn/) at Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China. I am from Pakistan, but currently live in Germany. 

My Post-Doc research focuses on assessing genetic diversity in crop genetic resources using computational analyses. I had the very good fortune to be advised by [Prof. Dr. Jiankang Wang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294609.htm) during my Ph.D. I was also co-advised by [Dr. Luyan Zhang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294611.htm) and [Dr. Awais Rasheed](http://www.qau.edu.pk/profile.php?id=804030) on my PhD research projects. After my Ph.D., I started Post-Doc with [Dr. Li Huihui](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm) at ICS-CAAS. My Post-Doc research project involved genetic characterization, assessment of genetic diversity, and identification of selection sweeps in wheat and maize.  

## Research Interests:

- Applied Quantitative Genetics
- Phenotype and genotype association studies (QTL, GWAS, GS)
- Data visualization

Iâ€™m very happy to talk about my research projects and sciences with you. Please feel free to PM me on Twitter (upper left corner).
