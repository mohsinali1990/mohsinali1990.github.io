Hello! My name is Mohsin Ali. I am currently working as a Post-Doc researcher in the [Quantiative Genetics Group](https://isbreeding.caas.cn/) at Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China. 

My current research focuses on assessing genetic diversity in crop genetic resources using computational analyses. I had the very good fortune to be advised by [Prof. Dr. Jiankang Wang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294609.htm) during my Ph.D. I was also co-advised by [Dr. Luyan Zhang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294611.htm), [Dr. Awais Rasheed](http://www.qau.edu.pk/profile.php?id=804030) on my PhD research projects. After my Ph.D., I started Post-Doc with [Dr. Li Huihui](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm) at ICS-CAAS. My Post-Doc research project involved genetic characterization, assement of genetic diversity, and identification of selection sweeps.  

I’m very happy to talk about my research projects and sciences with you. Please feel free to PM me on Twitter (upper left corner).
