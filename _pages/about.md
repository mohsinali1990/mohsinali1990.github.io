Hello! My name is Mohsin Ali. I present an overview of my professional profile. I am currently working as a Post-Doc researcher in the [Quantiative Genetics Group](https://isbreeding.caas.cn/) at the Institute of Crop Sciences (ICS), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China. My research focused on assessing genetic diversity in crop genetic resources using statistical genetics and computational biology. I am from Pakistan, but I currently live in Germany.

Long story short, I did M.Phil with [Dr. Umar Masood Qureshi](https://www.qau.edu.pk/profile.php?id=804029) in Molecular Plant Breeding from Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan. My research project was to identify QTL associated with yield and related traits in wheat, which involved lots of field phenotyping, statistical genetics and computational biology. This QTL mapping project developed my interest in Quantitative Genetics. After completing M.Phil degree, I was awarded a scholarship to pursue Ph.D. degree abroad at ICS-CAAS in Quantitive Genetics. I had the very good fortune to be advised by [Prof. Dr. Jiankang Wang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294609.htm) during my Ph.D. I was also co-advised by [Dr. Li Huihui](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm), [Dr. Luyan Zhang](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294611.htm) and [Dr. Awais Rasheed](http://www.qau.edu.pk/profile.php?id=804030) on my Ph.D. research projects. My Ph.D. thesis focused on assessing genomic prediction accuracy of qualitative and quantitative traits using empirical and simulation-based study. Right after completing Ph.D., I started Post-Doc with [Dr. Li Huihui](https://isbreedingen.caas.cn/member/staff/294610.htm) at ICS-CAAS. My Post-Doc research project involved genetic characterization, assessment of genetic diversity, and identification of selection sweeps in wheat and maize. 

## Research Interests:

- Applied Quantitative Genetics
- Phenotype and genotype association studies (QTL, GWAS, GS)
- Data visualization

Iâ€™m very happy to talk about my research projects and sciences with you. Please feel free to PM me on ResearchGate.
